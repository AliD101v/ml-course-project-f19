    This report investigates two questions.
    First, for a given selection of data sets, can we say what
    is the `best' classifier or the `best' regressor in terms
    of good predictions?
    How much does the answer depend on the particular selection of data sets?
    How much does the answer depend on our computational constraints?
    We investigate these questions using data sets from the UCI repository. Moreover, we consider these questions for a non-stationary dataset that exhibits periodic concept drift.
    Third, we compare the interpretability of a decision tree
    classifier to that of a convolutional neural network.
    We compare the decision tree visualization
    to `activation maximization', a technique to gain insight into
    the kinds of inputs that deep neural networks respond to.
