\begin{abstract}
    This report investigates two questions.
    First, for a given selection of data sets, can we say what
    is the `best' classifier or the `best' regressor in terms
    of good predictions?
    How much does the answer depend on the particular selection of data sets?
    How much does the answer depend on our computational constraints?
    We investigate these questions using data sets from the UCI repository.
    Second, we compare the interpretability of a decision tree
    classifier to that of a convolutional neural network.
    We compare the decision tree visualization
    to `activation maximization', a technique to gain insight into
    the kinds of inputs that deep neural networks respond to.

 The abstract above was drafted for you.
 You can submit your project without modifying it, except that you must
 add 1--2 sentences to characterize the main idea of your novelty component.
 The rest of this template contains a suggested document structure,
 but you can change it as you see fit.
 Apart from the abstract, You should of course delete the text, formulas, figures, and tables that are currently
 included in this template.
 The report must be 4 pages of content, plus an additional page for references (if applicable).
 Fitting your report into 4 pages may be difficult, as is often the case when writing papers.
