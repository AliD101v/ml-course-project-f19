\section{Overview of project code and data}

% DELETE THIS TEXT
{\em Optional section.} This is a guide written by you to help the course staff.
Here you can make a few brief comments to the course staff about where
they should start when looking at your project code, *e.g.* how to run your scripts and what
data files contain the experimental results you used to draw your conclusions.
If your project code already has such information in an obvious place, such as a `README.md`
then this section is not necessary.
