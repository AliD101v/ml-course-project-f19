\subsection{Interpretability Experiments}

% DELETE THIS TEXT
Here you'll review what you did to process the CIFAR data and train your models.
You should try to give some example of what you saw, in a figure---just enough to get
an idea and to support your conclusions about interpretability.
You'll then state your [hopefully collective] opinion on the interpretability of
these models in particular and on interpretability in general.
