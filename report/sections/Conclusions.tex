% DELETE THIS TEXT
Here you should summarize your thoughts on the questions asked in the abstract.
For which questions can you offer a conclusion or at least a strong opinion?
If a colleague of yours were about to download a dataset like the kind you studied here,
what classifier and training procedure would you recommend he/she use?
What regressor would you recommend, if any?
What model(s) performed the `worst' in your view?
And was the result of your `novelty component'?
Show that you understand what your experimental results imply and do not imply.
