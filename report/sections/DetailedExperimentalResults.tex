\section{Detailed experimental results}

% DELETE THIS TEXT
{\em Optional section.} Here you can place supplementary plots and tables if they are needed to
support your conclusions from the main report.
You can include up to 2 extra pages of such material.
They do not count towards your 4-page count.
However, the instructor and TAs should not be obligated to read this
section to understand your conclusions, it should only be used to provide `supplementary' details.
For example, as a full table of your performance results (algorithms $\times$ datasets)
for classification and regression may does not fit within the 4-page limit,
you can put such results here.
If you do not feel including extra figures is necessary, that is OK, just delete this section.
