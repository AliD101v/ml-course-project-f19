As an extra step, we consider the Nebraska weather prediction data provided by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\footnote{\url{}}. This a non-stationary dataset which exhibits periodic concept drift, meaning that the distribution of \(p(y|X)\) changes over time. This poses certain challenges for all classical learning methods which assume that the distribution of data never changes, i.e., data is always stationary. We compare the performance of the classification methods on this dataset.
