\section{Introduction}

% DELETE THIS TEXT
Here you should write an introduction to how you approached the project,
as if you were writing a short research paper.
The introduction should be concise but provide an overview of your
goals, your methodology and also provide brief mention of your novelty component.
Even though some of the goals may be mentioned in the abstract,
and some of the methodology is specified in the project guidelines,
you should still try to write this report if it were a paper,
and person reading had not seen the project guidelines.
Describe what you did in your own words, however---copying and pasting is not OK.

The introduction is not the place for detailed descriptions of data preprocessing,
training, hyperparameter search, testing, or success metrics.
It is OK to mention some specifics if it helps clarify, but the full details
should be explained later on, in the Methodology and Experiments sections.
Likewise you do not need to review your conclusions here---there
is a final section for that.

The introduction should be 1--1.5 columns in length.
